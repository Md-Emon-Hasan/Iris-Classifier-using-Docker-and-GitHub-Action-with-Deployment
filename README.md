## üê≥ Docker and CI/CD

### Docker

This project is containerized using Docker to ensure that the environment is consistent across different systems.

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t iris-classifier .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 iris-classifier
   ```

3. **Visit the application:**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Each commit triggers the following workflow:

- **Linting and Testing:** Automatically runs linting and tests to ensure code quality.
- **Build and Deploy:** Builds the Docker image and deploys the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Heroku).

You can find the CI/CD workflow file in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

---

## üåü Best Practices

Recommendations for maintaining and improving this project:

- **Model Updating:** Continuously retrain the model with new data to improve accuracy.
- **Container Security:** Ensure the Docker container is secure and free from vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling in both the app and the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Documentation:** Keep the documentation up-to-date with the latest changes and improvements.
